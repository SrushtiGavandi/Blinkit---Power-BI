## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

This project was built as a case study in consumer and retail analytics, with the goal of extracting actionable insights from Blinkit's sales data.

It helps answer:
- What type of outlets and city tiers drive the most revenue?
- Are customers leaning toward healthier (low-fat) items?
- Which product categories are top performers across different formats?

By visualizing metrics like average sales, ratings, and item mix, this dashboard offers a clear view into consumer behavior, outlet efficiency, and emerging trends in quick commerce.
